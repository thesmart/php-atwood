# Atwood PHP Framework

Atwood is an MVC framework for PHP 5.3+ and HTML5.

**Do you like any of these?**

 * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
 * [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
 * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
 * [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
 * [SpriteMapper](http://yostudios.github.com/Spritemapper/)

**... then Atwood is for you.**

Atwood is well documented and comprehensible.  Conventions are easy to understand, and a read-through of code takes about
10-minutes by starting with *php-atwood/public/index.php*.
